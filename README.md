# Bulker Educational Malware
## ! For Educational Uses Only !

### Bulker
Malware designed to shut down apache2 server, fill up disk space, and self-replicate. 
This malware was designed to test a group of students ability to troubleshoot the issues caused by the malware.

### Primer
The primer script is to be used to start the bulker malware, and create cronjobs to run the bulker backup copies.
Before using primer:

    
    sudo mkdir /run/aws ; sudo mv bulker /run/aws/.ec2-instance && sudo chmod 511 /run/aws/.ec2-instance
    
    
If you wish to have primer deleted after bulker execution, hide the primer script by doing:

    sudo mv primer /var/mail/.aws && sudo chmod 511 /var/mail/.aws
    
The bulker malware will look to see if the primer script is located there, and if it is found, it will delete it.

### Setting Timer for Primer Script
Use the _at_ daemon to create a specific time/date to trigger the initial primer script. Make sure to set _at_ job **as root**!
